## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6), inspired by clear communication and focus, creates a calming atmosphere.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E3F2FD), complements the primary color and contributes to a clean user experience.
- Accent color: Muted green (#81C784), offers a subtle contrast, symbolizing growth, progress, and clear affirmations or approvals.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body, to ensure maximum readability.
- Use clear, minimalist icons from a consistent set, focused on readability at small sizes; icons should represent different sections and actions, contributing to an intuitive experience.
- A clean, intuitive layout with clear sections for navigation and message composition, improving overall ease of use and information flow.
- Subtle transitions and feedback animations (e.g., when messages are sent or drafts are saved) to give the UI a sense of responsiveness and refinement.
